   Q: How can i change default login/password for admin interface ?
   A: It`s easy. Login to the admin interface with default values (super_admin/super_stats)
      then click Password Encrypter link, type your password in the first field and click
      Encrypt button. Now open config.inc.php find $site_user and $site_pass fields. Type
      your new username and encrypted password here, save your changes. That`s all.

   Q: I get this error:
        Query: UPDATE counters SET d2ladder_time = 1059899646 LIMIT 1 
        Error: Unknown column 'd2ladder_time' in 'field list'
      when i try to view Diablo II/LoD stats, what`s wrong ?
   A: You didn`t import d2ladder_new.sql in your PvPGN DB or you have old version of this
      table from 2.3.16 pvpgn-stats version, go and reread UPGRADE section in the install
      instructions.

   Q: I have read all the FAQ but i still have problems with the stats, what else can i do ?
   A: Well, if you still have any problems, that means that you have either dumb PHP
      configuration and(or) too old PHP version. The best idea would be to upgrade your PHP
      to the latest stable version (4.3.2 at the moment), and use php.ini-dist as an example
      of your configuration file. Then I can give you a 99% guarantee that everything will work.
  
   Q: I found a bug in the stats and(or) want to suggest some features, how can i do it ?
   A: Go to the www.stormzone.ru, register and leave message in the forum in the PvPGN
      Statistics System section or find me in the irc://irc.pvpgn.org as STORM and report
      what you wanted.
