 Q - Question
 A - Answer

   Q: I have read all the FAQ but i still have problems with the stats, what else can i do ?
   A: Well, if you still have any problems, that means that you have either dumb PHP
      configuration and(or) too old PHP version. The best idea would be to upgrade your PHP
      to the latest stable version (4.3.2 at the moment), and use php.ini-dist as an example
      of your configuration file. Then I can give you a 99% guarantee that everything will work.
  
   Q: I found a bug in the stats and(or) want to suggest some features, how can i do it ?
   A: Go to the forums.pvpgn.org, register and leave message in the forum in the PvPGN
      Statistics System section or find me in the irc://irc.pvpgn.org as STORM and report
      what you wanted.
      !NEW! Now you can also contact Katz in the pvpgn forums for bug reports and feature
      suggestions.

   Q: What is the address to pvpgn's forums ?
   A: The address is http://forums.pvpgn.org/ . In case it changes visit http://www.pvpgn.org/
      or use Google.
